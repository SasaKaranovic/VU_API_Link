# API Link


API Link allows you to create a link between an existing API and VU dials.
You can configure API Link to periodically make API calls, fetch information and display it on your VU dials.


# But... Why ?

APIs are typically used to share information, you may already be using some API services on a daily basis without even realizing it. There are many API services available to us, both free or paid, and whilst your favourite website or app is unlikely to add direct support for VU1, they may provide API access to that information.


For example, there are APIs to get weather information, stock/commodity prices, and even the time when the next SpaceX rocket will launch.


Visit [VU Dials Forum](https://forum.vudials.com) for feedback, support and to share your API configurations and ideas with others.
